# CNN Model for Face Emotion[happy, neutral, sad and surprise] Recognition

This model is build for Final year college project named __Paana: Journal featuring NLP, HTR, and CV__ in which images posted by user during journal posts are feed to model for face emotion recognition.

## Datasets
Two datasets from kaggle is merged and images with above emotions are retrieved.
- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- [AffectNet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mouadriali/affectnetsample)
- [FER + AffectNet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishkulung/ferandaffectnet)
